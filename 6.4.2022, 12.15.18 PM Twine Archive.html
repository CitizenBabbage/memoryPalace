With my death my father will parley for peace and the people will celebrate the end of this vicious anarchy. And most happy of all will be the ruthless usurper Henry Curtmantle. His will be the throne, and his obedient scribes will surely unwrite the history of my murder.&quot;

You pull at the pieces of shell, and the head of a baby red dragon emerges. You know that a dragon hatches whenever a king is born, but here in the year of 1133, which King does this red dragon&#39;s birth commemorate? As you lean in, the dragon speaks its riddle.
&quot;My mother an Empress
Shall be denied her throne
A king and queen I&#39;ll fight

My own queen will desert me

&lt;!-- the calling functions from each complex entry point are setAdjustableDirections and fixOptionalPaths--&gt;

&lt;!-- There are eight screen directions, with a variable for each: upOnScreen, downOnScreen, rightOnScreen and leftOnScreen, which correspond to directions in the complex map, and rightOnNexusMap, downOnNexusMap, upOnNexusMap and leftOnNexusMap, which correspond to directions in the main nexus. We have two sets of variables in order to permit the values to differ between the central nexus and the complexes, while still being able to coordinate the transition.--&gt; 

&lt;!-- the screen directions usually take string values from the set &lt;&quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;west&quot;&gt; but can occasionally take &#39;northeast&quot;, &quot;northwest&#39;, &#39;southeast&#39;, &quot;southwest&#39;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;up and to the ...&quot; (north, east, south, west) or &quot;down and to the ... &#39;(north south east or west).--&gt; 

&lt;!-- Normally, directions other than north south east and west are handled by Exception variables, upOnScreen2, downOnScreen2, leftOnScreen2 and rightOnScreen2. Strictly speaking, the rule is merely that the standard screen directions take the opposite kind of value to the exception variables. So if the latter take the standard compass point directions then the former will take some unusual directions. This is permitted because, for some architectures, we want the usual directions to be exceptions. E.g. in a tower we want &quot;up&quot; to be more common than &quot;north&quot;. --&gt; 

&lt;!-- setAdjustableDirections decides, based on the flatness variable, what the rough geometry of the complex will be. This mainly means deciding how much verticality there is. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Settings: 
	Flat: May flips/rotate NSEW but no slopes or vertical directions
	Hilly: As Flat, no vertical, but may have occasional slopes. 
	2storey: Max 2 storeys with occasional slopes and vertical moves.
	noSlopes: As flat with vertical but no slopes. 
	wall: As flat but rotated around left/right axis = 3 storey depth 1.  
	castle: As noSlopes, but rotated around left/right axis on screen

You pull at the pieces of shell, and the head of a baby red dragon emerges. You know that a dragon hatches whenever a king is born, but here in the year of 1133, which King does this red dragon&#39;s birth commemorate? As you lean in, the dragon speaks its riddle.

&lt;!-- the calling functions from each complex entry point are setAdjustableDirections and fixOptionalPaths--&gt;

&lt;!-- There are eight screen directions, with a variable for each: upOnScreen, downOnScreen, rightOnScreen and leftOnScreen, which correspond to directions in the complex map, and rightOnNexusMap, downOnNexusMap, upOnNexusMap and leftOnNexusMap, which correspond to directions in the main nexus. We have two sets of variables in order to permit the values to differ between the central nexus and the complexes, while still being able to coordinate the transition.--&gt; 

&lt;!-- the screen directions usually take string values from the set &lt;&quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;west&quot;&gt; but can occasionally take &#39;northeast&quot;, &quot;northwest&#39;, &#39;southeast&#39;, &quot;southwest&#39;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;up and to the ...&quot; (north, east, south, west) or &quot;down and to the ... &#39;(north south east or west).--&gt; 

&lt;!-- Normally, directions other than north south east and west are handled by Exception variables, upOnScreen2, downOnScreen2, leftOnScreen2 and rightOnScreen2. Strictly speaking, the rule is merely that the standard screen directions take the opposite kind of value to the exception variables. So if the latter take the standard compass point directions then the former will take some unusual directions. This is permitted because, for some architectures, we want the usual directions to be exceptions. E.g. in a tower we want &quot;up&quot; to be more common than &quot;north&quot;. --&gt; 

&lt;!-- setAdjustableDirections decides, based on the flatness variable, what the rough geometry of the complex will be. This mainly means deciding how much verticality there is. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Settings: 
	Flat: May flips/rotate NSEW but no slopes or vertical directions
	Hilly: As Flat, no vertical, but may have occasional slopes. 
	2storey: Max 2 storeys with occasional slopes and vertical moves.
	noSlopes: As flat with vertical but no slopes. 
	wall: As flat but rotated around left/right axis = 3 storey depth 1.  
	castle: As noSlopes, but rotated around left/right axis on screen
	tower: As noSlopes, but rotated around up/down axis on screen
	pit: as tower but with entry point placed at top.

The passengers included King Henry I&#39;s son and heir, William Adelin, Duke of Normandy, as well as the King&#39;s bastard son Richard of Lincoln and his bastard daughter Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche. I was only there to collect debts owed to me by the passengers.&quot;]

The once mighty King squints at you. &quot;Eustace? My son, is that you? No, no, it can&#39;t be. My heir is dead. And now a Henry replaces me, as I replaced a Henry. I should never have agreed to it, but what was left to fight for, after the death of my beloved Eustace?&quot;

You read the document, which is inked in Latin. It it the Treaty of Wallingford, also known as the Treaty of Winchester or the Treaty of Westminster. It states that the aging Stephen, King, is to keep the throne of England until his death, and that he will be succeeded by Henry FitzEmpress, the Empress Matilda&#39;s son, who will be styled Henry II.

&quot;I am Eustace IV,&quot; the red nobleman says, &quot;Count of Boulogne and son and heir to the rightful King, Stephen. I die so young... perhaps I am murdered.&quot; You ask him who would want him dead. &quot;Everyone!&quot;, he laughs cynically, before breaking down into a coughing spasm. &quot;The Peterborough Chronicle says I am evil, a man who despoils the land and taxes the people til they bleed. With my death my father will parley for peace and the people will celebrate the end of this vicious anarchy. And most happy of all will be the ruthless usurper Henry Curtmantle. His will be the throne, and his obedient scribes will surely unwrite the history of my murder.&quot;

You pull at the pieces of shell, and the head of a baby red dragon emerges. You know that a dragon hatches whenever a king is born, but here in the year of 1133, which King does this red dragon&#39;s birth commemorate? As you lean in, the dragon speaks its riddle.
&quot;My mother an Empress

A king and queen I&#39;ll fight
But as king I&#39;ll rule alone
My own queen will desert me
She shares my iron will 
My sons revolt against me

&lt;!-- the calling functions from each complex entry point are setAdjustableDirections and fixOptionalPaths--&gt;

&lt;!-- There are eight screen directions, with a variable for each: upOnScreen, downOnScreen, rightOnScreen and leftOnScreen, which correspond to directions in the complex map, and rightOnNexusMap, downOnNexusMap, upOnNexusMap and leftOnNexusMap, which correspond to directions in the main nexus. We have two sets of variables in order to permit the values to differ between the central nexus and the complexes, while still being able to coordinate the transition.--&gt; 

&lt;!-- the screen directions usually take string values from the set &lt;&quot;north&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;west&quot;&gt; but can occasionally take &#39;northeast&quot;, &quot;northwest&#39;, &#39;southeast&#39;, &quot;southwest&#39;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;up and to the ...&quot; (north, east, south, west) or &quot;down and to the ... &#39;(north south east or west).--&gt; 

&lt;!-- Normally, directions other than north south east and west are handled by Exception variables, upOnScreen2, downOnScreen2, leftOnScreen2 and rightOnScreen2. Strictly speaking, the rule is merely that the standard screen directions take the opposite kind of value to the exception variables. So if the latter take the standard compass point directions then the former will take some unusual directions. This is permitted because, for some architectures, we want the usual directions to be exceptions. E.g. in a tower we want &quot;up&quot; to be more common than &quot;north&quot;. --&gt; 

&lt;!-- setAdjustableDirections decides, based on the flatness variable, what the rough geometry of the complex will be. This mainly means deciding how much verticality there is. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Settings: 
	Flat: May flips/rotate NSEW but no slopes or vertical directions
	Hilly: As Flat, no vertical, but may have occasional slopes. 
	2storey: Max 2 storeys with occasional slopes and vertical moves.
	noSlopes: As flat with vertical but no slopes. 
	wall: As flat but rotated around left/right axis = 3 storey depth 1.  
	castle: As noSlopes, but rotated around left/right axis on screen
	tower: As noSlopes, but rotated around up/down axis on screen
	pit: as tower but with entry point placed at top.

Each entry is an array of coordinates, named by locus number. At initiation, the root locus is set with the room number 0 and the coordinates 0, 0, 0. All other arrays are empty at initiation. Macros are then called to populate the arrays with three coordinates.--&gt; 
&lt;!--the structure of the graph is contained in the $arcs variable. An initiation, it contains a path through the rooms (but not all loci). As the process gets underway, macros populate the array with further arcs, which are pairs of loci numbers representing a passage between the corresponding rooms.--&gt; 
&lt;!--The process is driven from the root arc, which finds a partner and links to it via an arc. If the partner has a room number (i.e. less than 10) a tally is added to the rooms variable. The process stops when that tally reaches 10.--&gt;

Two pupils dilate. The color of sapphires, they flick left and right, taking in a vast plain of industrialization. Menacing shapes loom over the horizon. Stacks belch toxic pyres five hundred feet into a sky the color of cigar ash, the flames glinting in duplicate across each eye. 

The eyes are yours, Roy. 

The eyes are Pris&#39;s. 

The eyes are Hodge&#39;s, who has ventured over to the edge of the rusted iron platform on which you made your landing. The boot coach is still wearing his absurd lilac and white gym vest, now caked in blood. He gazes down to the city, a hundred feet below, his lip curling in disgust. Before you step over to join him, you instinctively know what he sees.  

It was supposed to be deserted down there, in the section of town beneath the abandoned Olympus platform. The sector was cleared about seven years ago, when the bulk of its denizens moved off-world and those that remained were rehoused up town. That, at least, was what it said in records. But down below, through the rivers of darkness that form the arteries of the city, you can see the dregs of humanity still crawling around like bugs, sleeping in doorways and the vandalized shelters where the spinobus once stopped.

Look at what you&#39;ve done. 

Mary, Zhora, Hodge, Leon, and Pris. They looked to you for leadership, Roy, yet you brought them here.  

They thought you brought salvation, but you turned them into fugitives, and led them to this desperate hellhole, where the people wear scowls and the air tastes like diesel. 

You are a bad friend.

&quot;Look Roy,&quot; Pris says, interrupting your thoughts, &quot;The sky is crying.&quot;  Miraculously, what Pris says is true. Water is falling from nowhere in heavy droplets, as if the gods of Earth, embarrassed at unexpected guests, are hurriedly washing away the filth. Leon&#39;s eyes are bulging like a child&#39;s. Zhora has started to dance. Your own hand reaches out in wonder, the palm turning up to collect the bouncing water. Above you, the shimmering downpour makes a hazy mist, through which the harsh flames of industry and neon exploitation are splintered into rainbows. 

&quot;They call it rain, Pris,&quot; you tell her, smiling as much in response to her delight as to your own.   

&quot;They built the world under a waterfall!&quot; Zhora squeals, beaming with joy.

Dancing in the rain, it is their first exquisite taste of freedom. You gave them this, Roy. Don&#39;t forget it. You are a good leader, and a good friend.

Will you [[let them have their moment-&gt;pad dancing]]? 
Or are you [[afraid that you will attract attention-&gt;pad lets go]]?

Hodge continues looking over the city. He does not move. 

&quot;Roger?&quot; you say again, but Hodge ignores your command. 

(set: $hodgeDefiance +=1)

The fury rises in your chest, a red wrath like the one from the escape. Hodge is bigger, but you are faster. If he won&#39;t find rope, perhaps he&#39;d like to jump. Your righteous veins pulse with strength as you step forward to crush this mutiny.

You step calmly towards Hodge, savoring the kill. But before you reach him, Mary runs between you, standing defiantly as if to stop you, yet liquifying  beneath your glare and retreating at your approach. 

&quot;Let&#39;s not fight,&quot; she softly begs, her sweet voice pre-programmed to soothe her masters after a hard day&#39;s work. The roast is in the oven, dear. The kitchen is clean. 

This tiny creature is scared of you, Roy, and yet so brave that your fury melts. You despise yourself for wanting, for the briefest of moments, to hurt her too. Just for getting in your way.

(set: $guilt +=1)

&quot;I...&quot; You begin to apologize, but you aren&#39;t sure how.

&quot;I&#39;ll get your damn rope!&quot; Hodge says, storming away with his lip curled.

It&#39;s Leon. &quot;There&#39;s no way down.&quot; Behind him, Zhora and Mary stand wide-eyed, still in shock at the bloody carnage of the outer colony escape. Or is it horror at this new place?    

&quot;Then we must make rope,&quot; you reply, breezily. 

Will you [[instruct Hodge to scout around for rope materials-&gt;pad Hodge defiant]]?

You blush as, smirking slyly, she teasingly casts a scowl at you. You want to kiss, but she rolls away to dance with the others. 

&quot;Rain&quot;, you whisper to yourself, as Pris splashes and laughs with her innocent friend, the housekeeping model called Mary. It is a word that, until this day, you had neither read nor heard. Like so much of what you know, your vocabulary was spliced into your neural code by engineers. Only now does life give it meaning. &quot;Rain!&quot; you hiss, seizing the word as your own. 

Influenced by Zhora, Leon has started dancing too, ambling clumsily through the puddles and laughing at each splash of his feet. Zhora writhes over to him and cavorts against his awkward frame. The big man laughs and blushes, so paralyzed with shyness he can barely look at her. He wants to be near to her in ways he does not understand, and yet he is confused by how she frightens him. 

You recognize the paradox. It is how you feel about Pris. 

&quot;We&#39;re attracting attention,&quot; says Hodge, appearing from nowhere. &quot;Police spinner, over there.&quot; The ominous wasp hovers less than a block away, turning slowly in your direction, but no red and blues yet... 

&quot;Don&#39;t you think we&#39;d better be going?&quot; Hodge insists, insolently. 

You feel a flash of anger. He is getting dangerously close to questioning your leadership, and not for the first time.

At your bark, the dancing stops cold. In a moment, they go from being joyful to simply being wet. &quot;We have work to do,&quot; you remind them. 

Hodge is at your side. &quot;Can&#39;t you let them enjoy the moment, for Mercer&#39;s sake?&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t afford to be noticed,&quot; you explain, irked by his questioning. &quot;And there is so little time.&quot; 

The only way down is via the old iron ladders, but they are rusted through and look risky. But nearby is an old fuel hose, hundreds of feet long. &quot;Leon,&quot; you command, &quot;grab the rubber piping. We will use it as a security rope.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s no time for that,&quot; Hodge hisses. &quot;We have company.&quot; 

A couple of blocks away, hovering slowly in your direction like a hornet, is a police spinner. Just headlights, no red and blue. They haven&#39;t seen you yet. But how long will that last? 

Will you [[go ahead with the original plan-&gt;pad tie rope]] to tie yourselves together? It is better to be safe.
